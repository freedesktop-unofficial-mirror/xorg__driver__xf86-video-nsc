Please note that this driver is seriously deprecated and X.org developers
cannot guarantee that it will be supported in upcoming X.org releases.

Support for Cyrix and NSC Geodes shall be merged into xf86-video-geode,
after which xf86-video-cyrix and xf86-video-nsc will be retired. Please
contact the X.org Geode mailing list (see subscription instructions on
the project homepage) if you can contribute towards reaching this goal.

Until then, the current situation for Geode coverage is as follow:
 
xf86-video-geode
 * AMD Geode LX (a.k.a. GX3) PCI ID 0x1022:0x2081
 * AMD Geode GX (a.k.a. GX2) PCI ID 0x100B:0x0030 

xf86-video-nsc
 * NSC Geode GX (a.k.a. GX2) PCI ID 0x100B:0x0030
 * NSC Geode SC (a.k.a. GX1) PCI ID 0x100B:0x0504

xf86-video-cyrix
 * Cyrix Geode  (a.k.a. GX1) PCI ID 0x1078:0x0104

Please note that both NSC and GEODE support GX2. This is indeed correct.
However, only GEODE has up-to-date code, while NSC is deprecated.

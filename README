Please note that this driver is seriously deprecated and X.org developers
cannot guarantee that it will be supported in upcoming X.org releases.

Support for Cyrix and NSC Geodes shall be merged into xf86-video-geode,
after which xf86-video-cyrix and xf86-video-nsc will be retired. Please
contact the X.org Geode mailing list (see subscribtion instructions on
the project's homepage) if you can contribute towards reaching this goal.
